Unix is an operating system which was developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie in 1960s as a hobby with a team of  developers in AT & T bell labs
It is derived from another OS known as MULTICS.
It was initially named as Unics but later renamed as Unix.
Dennis Ritchie later also created C programming.

Unix provided a platform for users to interact with the hardware which was very needed at that time.
It's developers made it open-source to be used freely by anyone and since then it was customised by many users as per to some specific needs
which lead to multiples version of unix.
Mac OS is also a descendant of unix.
Linux was also made from available code of unix. Linux is not the same as unix but unix like code. 
it has GNU which stands for "GNU not unix".
