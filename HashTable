HashTable - 
Data structure which uses key-value pairs.
A hashing function is applied on the key which generates Index(memory location where it's matching value is stored}
It provides quick operations like insertion, deletion, searching with a O(1) time complexity.

HashMap is a class in java which have prebuilt methods that we can use.
Methods-
.containsKey() - checks if the given key exists in hashmao or not. 
returns true if value is found and false  if not.
Time complexity - O(1) 

.containsValue() - checks if the given Value exists in hashmap or not.
returns true if value is found and false  if not.
Time complexity - O(n)
